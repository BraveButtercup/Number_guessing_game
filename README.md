Link to the game:  https://bravebuttercup.github.io/Number_guessing_game/

The computer generate a whole number between 1 and 100.
The user writes their guess into the input field. For each guess, the computer responds with one of the following:

   - Your guess is lower!
   - Your guess is higher!
   - Congratulations, you've guessed it!

   Once the user guesses the generated number, the game ends.
   A new game can be started at any time. In this case, the previous guesses are deleted and the computer generates a new number. 
   The list of guesses is visible during the game.
